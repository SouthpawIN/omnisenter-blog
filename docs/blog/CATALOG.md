# OmniSenter Blog Catalog

> **The one page that indexes everything.** Every post in the OmniSenter
> blog catalog, with summaries, reading order, and cross-links to HF
> models + GitHub repos.

## Start here

If you only read one post, read **[`the-omni-family.md`](./the-omni-family.md)**.
It explains the naming convention that every other post uses. Without
it, "Senter", "Ohm", and "OmniSenter" sound like noise.

If you read two posts, add **[`the-agent-hub-markdown-as-agents.md`](./the-agent-hub-markdown-as-agents.md)**.
It's the unified surface that ties the local model server, the
evolutionary radio, the note-taker, and the LLM wiki together. **The
wiki IS the agent spec.**

## Current state (transitional)

The models currently published on HuggingFace under `sovthpaw/` are the
**v1 transitional** lineage:

- **[`sovthpaw/omnistep-12a3b`](https://huggingface.co/sovthpaw/omnistep-12a3b)**
  — 12B total / 3B active, multimodal, 4 GGUFs + 4 safetensors
- **[`sovthpaw/Omni-Senter-3B`](https://huggingface.co/sovthpaw/Omni-Senter-3B)**
  — 3B early Senter, LoRA + GGUF
- **[`sovthpaw/OmniSenter-Base-16B`](https://huggingface.co/sovthpaw/OmniSenter-Base-16B)**
  — 16B base, multimodal (Qwen3-8B + Cosmos3-Nano Darwin merge)

The new architecture (4 models — OmniStep / OmniStep Ohm / Senter /
Senter Ohm) will **replace** these as it ships. The new architecture
always includes the 4 mandatory build blocks: **Cosmos + Nemotron
0.6B streaming ASR + 8B agentic SFT + ACE-Step** (music is in the
DNA). They're foundation, not destination.

## The posts (18)

### 🏛️ Foundations (read first)

| Post | What's in it | Read time |
|---|---|---|
| **[`the-omni-family.md`](./the-omni-family.md)** | The naming convention: Omni (multimodal), Senter (agentic), Ohm (self-evolving), Senter Ohm (the flagship). With a family tree and the 4 mandatory build blocks. | 5 min |

## Naming rules (read first)

Per the 2026-06-08 architecture rule:

1. **"OmniSenter" is the project name. Never a model name.**
2. **The 4 model names are exactly**: `OmniStep`, `OmniStep Ohm`,
   `Senter`, `Senter Ohm`.
3. **ACE-Step is mandatory** in every Omni model (Standard and Ohm
   alike). Music is in the DNA.
4. **Cosmos + Nemotron 0.6B ASR + 8B SFT + ACE-Step** are the
   4 mandatory build blocks. Remove none.

If you see "OmniSenter 12B", "OmniSenterStep", or "Senter Ohm 32A8B"
in any old post, those are **legacy names from before 2026-06-08**.
The post may have a "renamed from" callout at the top.
